Types of Linear Regression:The interpretability of linear regression is a notable strength. The model’s equation provides clear coefficients that elucidate the impact of each independent variable on the dependent variable, facilitating a deeper understanding of the underlying dynamics. Its simplicity is a virtue, as linear regression is transparent, easy to implement, and serves as a foundational concept for more complex algorithms.

There are two main types of linear regression:

# SIMPLE LINEAAR REGRESSION:
This is the simplest form of linear regression, and it involves only one independent variable and one dependent variable. The equation for simple linear regression is:
𝑦 = 𝛽0+𝛽1𝑋
where:
Y is the dependent variable
X is the independent variable
β0 is the intercept
β1 is the slope

# MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION:

This involves more than one independent variable and one dependent variable.The equation for multiple linear regression is:
𝑦=𝛽0+𝛽1𝑋+𝛽2𝑋+………𝛽𝑛X
where:
Y is the dependent variable
X1, X2, …, Xp are the independent variables
β0 is the intercept
β1, β2, …, βn are the slopes
